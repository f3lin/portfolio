# Portfolio
This is my portfolio in development. The aim is to make it interact with a Spring Boot Rest Api ( [portfolio-for-enterprise](https://github.com/nal95/portfolio-for-enterprise) also in development) to facilitate communication between me and any visitors on the one hand, and to update my knowledge database on the other.

The current version gives visitors an idea of who I am and what I know to date. But development continues, so stay tuned ...
